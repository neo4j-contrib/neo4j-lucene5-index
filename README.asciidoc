== Neo4j Lucene 5 integration

This is still experimental and preliminary and completely unsupported.
It only works with new datastores or databases with all `schema` and `index` directories removed.

The integration is built on top of Neo4j 2.3.0

[NOTE]
If you want to try this on an existing database, make a backup before!

=== Installation

Build the library with mvn clean install dependency:copy-dependencies

Remove neo4j-lucene-index.jar and all lucene jars from your Neo4j server.

----
# build
mvn clean install dependency:copy-dependencies

# set your neo4j server path
export NEO=/path/to/neo4j-community-2.3.0

$NEO/bin/neo4j stop

mkdir $NEO/backup
mv $NEO/data/graph.db/schema $NEO/data/graph.db/index $NEO/backup
mv $NEO/lib/lucene-core-3.6.2.jar $NEO/lib/neo4j-lucene-index-2.3.0.jar $NEO/backup
